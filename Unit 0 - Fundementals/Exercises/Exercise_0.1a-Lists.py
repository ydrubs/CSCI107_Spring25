Exercise 0.1 - Lists:

Do the following
    1) Generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 20
    2) Find and print the biggest number on the list
    3) Find and print the SECOND biggest number on the list

    4) DO NOT USE the max() or min() command to do this!

    KEEP IN MIND: There can be cases where the biggest number occurs more than once.
                Your code should be able to handle that and print it only once.
                Assume that, there is at least TWO DIFFERENT values in the list
