"""
The Collatz number is a famous unsolved problem in math that can be easily explained with three simple rules.

From a starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next number in the sequence:
1)	If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
2)	If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
3)	If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.

Example: Start with n = 26. If you follow the rules, the sequence of number would be:
    ïƒ¨	26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Your task:
    1)	Ask the user to enter a starting integer greater than 0

    2)	Write a function called collatz_sequence that can return a list representing the sequence
        that follows the Collatz rules for n.

     - 	For example by typing in collatz_sequence(number), where number = 100, you should get:
            [100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
