Exercise 0.4

Rewrite the  Twilzzelrs script from the  beginning of this lesson using what you learned about exception handling.

Implement the following:
    1) A ValueError when someone tries to add a negative amount to their cart with a custom message
    2) An error saying something like ‘invalid input’ when a non-interger value is entered.
    3) A generic exception for any other errors saying something “like an unknown error occurred”
    4) Add that number to the twizzler_count variable if it is a valid input
