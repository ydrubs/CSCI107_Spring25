part 1 - given a class called WordFind, we want to:
    1) create an instance from a word passed in to the __init__ of the class (has the string as an attribute)
    2) Return the string passed in when calling the object through print
    3) Index into the object as though it were a normal string 
"""

# The __str__ magic method tells Python how to return an object when it is called directly
# By default this returns a memory reference to the object if not implemented
pass


# The __getitem__ magic method tells python how to return the INDEX of an object when referenced using <obj>[i]
pass

# Testing

part 2 - How does Python utilize operator overload with arithmetic functions?
    Given an arithmetic operation, how does Python hande operations such as '+' or '*' on different data types 

    NOTICE - Same operations could be used across different data types

Part 3 - Implementing Custom Operators using magic methods

    Create a new class to make working with Rational Numbers (Fractions) easier. The objects in the class should - 
        - be able to utilize the 4 basic operations '+' '-' '*' and '/' in order to calculate and return another rational number (fraction)
