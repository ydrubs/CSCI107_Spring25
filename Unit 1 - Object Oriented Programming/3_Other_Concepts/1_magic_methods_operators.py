part 1 - given a class called WordFind, we want to:
    1) create an instance from a word passed in to the __init__ of the class
    2) Return the string passed in when calling the object through print
    3) Index into the object as though it were a normal string

part 2 - How does Python utilize operator overload with arithmetic functions?
    Given an arithmetic operation, how does Python hande operations such as '+' or '*' on different data types 

    NOTICE - Same operations could be used across different data types

Part 3 - Implementing Custom Operators using magic methods

    Create a new class to make working with Rational Numbers (Fractions) easier. The objects in the class should - 
        - be able to utilize the 4 basic operations '+' '-' '*' and '/' in order to calculate and return another rational number (fraction)
