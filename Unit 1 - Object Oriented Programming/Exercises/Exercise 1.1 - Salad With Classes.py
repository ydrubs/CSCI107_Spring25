Exercise 1.1 - Salad with classes (done after vehicle 1.2 lesson)

Suppose creating a class is similar to making a salad.
Salads come in many varieties, however ALL salads involve some common traits:

    1) The class represents the Salad that is made.
    2) The attributes represent the ingredients that the salad has.
        - We can pass in specific ingredients as parameters when making an instance of the salad object
    3) The methods represent things we do to make the salad (check for freshness, cut ingredients, mix , etc...)

Your task:
    1) Create a class called Salad

    2) Include the attributes that are passed in when creating the instance.
        - This can be a string, tuple, or list

    3) Include the methods that might be needed to make the salad (you don't need to implement the methods)

    4) Create and test the object you create by calling the attributes.
