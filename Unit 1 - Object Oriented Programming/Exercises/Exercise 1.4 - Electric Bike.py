Exercise 1.4 Electric Bike

Copy the vehicle5 inheritence code here as a starting point.

Add an electric bike class, call it 'Ebike'. The class should inherit from the electric vehicle class.

The Ebike class should add a new attribute called 'battery_cap_percent' passed in when the instance is created.
This attribute keeps track of the battery capacity which effects the miles_per_charge.

Add a method called get miles per charge to the Ebike class that returns the miles per_charge as a percentage of battery capacity.
For example: battery_cap_percent passed in is 90, and miles_per_charge passed in when the Ebike instance is created is set to 120,
then get_miles_per_charge would return 108 (because 108 is 9 percent of 120)

Test your class to ensure it works.
