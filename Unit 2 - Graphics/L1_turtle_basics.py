""""
Turtle graphics originated from the 'Logo' programming language as a way to teach
beginners how to work with graphics and code.

It uses a 'turtle' to draw graphics onto the screen. So sending movement commands to the tutorials
is analgous to drawing on to the screen.

The Turtle module could also be used for elaborate, complex graphics.
