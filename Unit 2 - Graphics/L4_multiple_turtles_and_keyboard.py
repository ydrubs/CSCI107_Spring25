"""In this lesson we will explore how to use multiple turtles for drawing on to the screen.
We create instance variables from the turtle class rather then using the generic class as in previous lessons.
"""
import turtle

## Create an instance of the turtle screen object

##Create and store turtles into the list

# turtle 1



# turtle 2



# turtle 3


## Send commands to each turtle individuals





##Send commands to each turtle by looping through the list




# Write to the screen but with formatting

##Define functions for keyboard presses
# When up key is pressed trigger this function



# When down key is pressed trigger this function


# When left key is pressed trigger this function



# When right key is pressed trigger this function



##Create a keypress listener and assosiate with a key
